# RGP dicr

dicr is an RPG dice roller.

This is build as a hobby project to learn and experiment with nodejs.

# Usage

Rolling a single six sided die:

```
./roll 2d6 # => 8
```

The number of dice is assumed to be one (1) unless otherwise specified, and can therefor be omitted:

```
./roll d6 # => 3
```
